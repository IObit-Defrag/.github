## Overview  

**IObit Smart Defrag** is a leading **disk optimization and defragmentation software** created to keep your PC running at peak performance. Over time, files stored on your computer become fragmented, causing slower access speeds, longer boot times, and reduced overall efficiency. Smart Defrag solves this issue by intelligently rearranging files for faster and smoother system performance.  

The software supports **traditional HDD defragmentation** as well as **advanced SSD optimization**, ensuring that both types of drives are handled with the best methods for speed and longevity. Unlike basic built-in defragmentation tools, Smart Defrag offers **real-time optimization, boot-time defrag, and game optimization features**, making it suitable for gamers, professionals, and everyday users.  

One of its standout features is **automatic background defragmentation**, which ensures your PC stays optimized without manual intervention. Smart Defrag also includes **boot-time defrag** to clean up critical system files before Windows starts, improving startup speed. For gamers, the **Game Optimize mode** reduces stuttering and loading times by prioritizing game-related files.  

The software is lightweight, easy to use, and integrates seamlessly into daily computer use. With its **intelligent algorithms and customizable settings**, IObit Smart Defrag adapts to user needs, delivering consistently faster performance without heavy system resource usage.
